Hello Friends!
Welcome to my YouTube channel "Programming Knowledge".
First of all, I want to wish Happy Republic Day to all of you.

In this video, I will show you what is the output of this program.

Also, I have made a ringtone of National anthem of India in C language and also in Java.
check out this videos, I will provide links in the description.

Before compiling this code, I want to share that how I inspire to make this small obfuscated program.

Well, on this channel, I have uploaded 2 videos in this series.
In first one, I have shown what is code obfuscation and how to convert this simple program to obfuscated code. I have provided the link in the description.
In second video, I have explained some basics techniques by which you can de-obfuscat the obfuscated code.

When I was searching about this particular topics, I have found some images as shown here.
By inspiring these images, I have decided to make a small program.
So, let's compile this code.
